# Copilot instructions for this repository

Purpose
- Provide short, actionable instructions so an AI coding agent can be productive here.

Repo snapshot (automatically generated by agent)
- Top-level files discovered: `readme.md` (empty)

Immediate actions for an AI agent
- Detect the project language and build system by searching for common manifests: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `build.gradle`, etc.
- If no manifests or source files are present (this repo currently only contains `readme.md`), stop and ask the repository owner: "What is the project language and the commands to build/test/run?"
- Look for CI/workflow files under `.github/workflows/` before changing CI-related files.
- When in doubt, read `readme.md` first and then request clarification rather than guessing.

Discoverable patterns in this repository
- No language-specific files or build/test scripts were found. Do not assume a default language or framework.

Conventions for edits and PRs
- Make minimal, focused changes with a short PR description explaining intent and commands to verify locally.
- If adding build/test scripts, update `readme.md` with exact commands and expected results.
- Preserve and merge any existing content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if present; append a short "Repo snapshot" line mentioning newly discovered files and the date.

Safe operational rules
- Do not execute remote install scripts or networked commands without explicit approval from the repo owner.
- Do not add or commit secrets, keys, or credentials.
- Prefer code changes that are reversible; avoid wide-scope refactors unless requested.

Examples (how to behave here)
- This repo: open `readme.md`, note it's empty, then ask: "Which language/build system should I use?" rather than scaffolding a project arbitrarily.
- If you find `package.json`, recommended quick checks (ask first): `npm ci` then `npm test`.

When to ask the owner
- Missing or ambiguous build/test/run instructions.
- Multiple language manifests present.
- Any change that touches deployment, CI, or infra config.

Contact and follow-up
- After making a proposed change, include a brief verification checklist in the PR and request review from the repository owner.
